    <li><b>Socialscribe</b> — Socialscribe lets newsletter creators add social sign-up buttons (<span class="text-white text-sm uppercase font-mono px-3 py-1 rounded-lg bg-gray-500">sign-up with google</span>) to their websites without coding. I designed and built the entire thing up and grew it to about $900 in profits.
    </li> <br>

    <li><b>Twift (now defunct)</b> – Now defunct, Twift helped creators run "reply with an 👋" giveaways on Twitter, handling sending thousands of DMs without being marked as spam. I built and designed the whole web-app and DM-ing engine while Prado (@pradologue) helped me with growing it to hundreds of users. We had to eventually shut down when the Twitter API pricing change made this too expensive to continue ($40k/month to be exact).    </li>
    <br>

    <li><b>Dump.ink</b> – Dump is a minimal micro-blogging platform I built for Deta Space which lets anybody create and host their own microblogs for free for ever. It is completely decentralised. Deta offered to buy it from me if I turned it into a decentralised social media protocol which I couldn't work on as life got in the way. I may continue this in the future.    </li>
    <br>

    <li><b>Back of my Head (now defunct)</b> – I ran an email newsletter rounding up cool stuff I found throughout the week. It went on the get over a thousand subscribers but I couldn't be consistent and decided to drop it.
