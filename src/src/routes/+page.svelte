    Hi! I'm Kunal, an electronics major at BITS, Goa.
    <br><br>
    Right now, I'm interning at <a href="http://biocomputeinc.com">BioCompute, Inc</a> for computational research and working in <a href="http://arnabkrpaul.github.io/Dashlab/">DaSH lab</a> under Prof Arnab Paul among a few other engagements. 
    <br><br>

    I fell in love with computers and the Internet when I was 10. 
    Ever since, I have written a few newsletters, did content marketing
    and SEO for startups and built a bunch of web-apps that earned me some
    pocket money.
