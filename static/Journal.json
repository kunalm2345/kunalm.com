And I and some more people are sitting on stuff being pushed by the train. so like a moving chair I\u0027m sitting on and training moving left like whole body of training is moving flat left towards a station. i wonder what happens if we reach statement because aise toh we\u0027ll crash with the platform. I imagine me standing and getting into the train and leaving the stuff there. but then i wonder what happens to the stuff. then I see I\u0027m inside the train. but one chair is still outside. another train comes now. we are moving vertically. like normally. some more stuff like a baseball bat is now swinging in the air bouncing off of the body of the two trains very rapidly. not hurting anyone tho because everyone is inside. except this one uncle who went out to grab smth and now was sitting at the place where two magnets hold two boggies together. another slightly younger dude with him. some time later, one of those material that baseball bat hits that other guy, as both of them are holding tight, in his head. The thing I\u0027m watching shows a description of how this happens: animated bat breaking a cement like structure representing his skull and i rewind and tell my sister about this. i tell her wake up but keep your eyes closed if you don\u0027t want spoilers and i describe it to her.\"}],\"meta\":{\"version\":1,\"created\":{\"version\":1730768887,\"platform\":\"webapp\"},\"small-lines-removed\":true}}","creationDate":"2024-10-11T18:30:00Z","modifiedDate":"2024-11-07T08:09:50Z","creationDevice":"Desktop","creationOSName":"macOS","creationOSVersion":"15.1.0","creationDeviceType":"WebApp","timeZone":"Asia/Calcutta","tags":["dreamt of"],"v":{}},{"uuid":"D274361444B8532192F1FED13BFFE9C7","starred":false,"pinned":false,"text":"Haven\u0027t had a FB account in 19 years of my life.

She deserves to get a butterflies in her stomach wala love story atleast once.\n2. People prefering attraction as a main cause in their relationships is like a bell curve: Noobs want only physical attraction, hot partners.

But this was her first too.\n\n\nPlan of action:\n- Put efforts on yourself. Get more attractive. **If you think you deserve someone who looks good, she deserves it too.**\n- Delete your pathetic-ass feelings for her without painting her as a bad person.\n\n\n**The only way this will happen if your current life is happier than your imagined life with her.** What\u0027s happier?

Be more frank, blunt and honest. But be considerate, careful and trustable 10x more.\n\nLong term happiness is when you have a sense of hold over your life. The way to get this is by managing time and putting efforts into everything you do everyday.\n\nStudy. Play a sport. Learn singing. Run around. Freelance.

thing im telling you about her:  (no need to reply)\n\nif she does have, she should so any sign. anything at all. even giving me more attention counts. or talking to me. or\n anything. \n\nrn, plan is I\u0027ve stopped messaging her. \n\n(whole another story: i always message first, she replies late slow and minimal and she looks very disinterested to talk. when i feel like i wanna talk i convince myself i shouldn\u0027t wait to be who im and i just say it. last time someone did this exact thing to me, she was that girl who later blocked me, yk her. she was clearly disinterested in talking so acted like this and i kept forcing the convo. and now it feels terrible.\n\n so im not gonna msg her first from now on. if she does, then ok but from now on, no more msg-ing first. it does feel like playing status games vs actual value games but okay. and there was a brief period of time when she did msg first sometimes idk what was with her then but it certainly isn\u0027t so now. \n\nside note ends)\n\n\nplan part 2 is I\u0027m gonna ask her why she blocked me. if she has a plausible explanation for that everything else is sorted. that\u0027s the only part of the puzzle that makes your argument (that she\u0027s a crush on me) storing. without it it\u0027s done. no clarification needed.\n\nif she doesn\u0027t, which again makes your argument stronger, I\u0027ll ask her to tell me atleast when she\u0027ll tell encouraging her to tell right before she leaves for jaipur maybe that\u0027ll make it easier for her to tell.\n\nif she still doesn\u0027t, I\u0027m gonna ask her directly if she\u0027s got a crush on me. on chats. after she\u0027s gone. so I\u0027ll be prepared for a no and an awkward reaction from her because I\u0027ll not meet her for months and no need to talk so i might as well block her myself. \n\nrn the best case scenario would be she having a plausible reason for blocking me which will put an end to all this. me you and gf failed to find such a reason which means if she tells any reason which makes sense she\u0027s not lying or making it up. if she had to lie, she wouldn\u0027t tell which is a open option to her in case she indeed has a crush on me. \n\nmedium case scenario would be she saying hell no when i ask her directly. that\u0027d make it way awkward but she won\u0027t be back for 1.5 months so I\u0027m safe. and she might forget or I\u0027ll act like I\u0027ve forgotten when she comes back.\n\nworst case scenario though is she saying some form of yes. honestly i dont want that to happen. and realistically i do realise i shouldn\u0027t be doing all this to find out. but i just can find peace with not knowing. curiosity (idk even if should call it that) is killing me. \n\nif that happens, i still have 1.5 months to politely decline and offer to be friends only. \n\n(another side note: remember her story of how a guy proposed to her? she mentioned then that she hates pda. so still this very less chances she\u0027ll ever propose even if she tells me she likes me.)\n\nPROBABILITIES\n\nto be roughly realistic, the probability of 1st case i think is 30%, 2nd is 50+% and third is 10-20%
