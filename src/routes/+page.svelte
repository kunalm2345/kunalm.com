    Hi! I'm Kunal, an electronics major at BITS, Goa.
    <br><br>
    Right now, I split my time between classes, working on research projects, working on a freelance hardware project, working on a CANSAT team and learning Computer Networks.
    <br><br>
    Before that, I part-time built features at Buttondown and did computational research at <a href="https://biocomputeinc.com">BioCompute, Inc</a> (they got WTFund'ed!).
    <br><br>

    I fell in love with computers and the Internet when I was 10.
    Ever since, I have written a few newsletters, did SEO, designing and consultant-work for startups and built a bunch of saas products that earned me some
    pocket money.
