# My personal website

Made using Svelte and SvelteKit and hosted on Vercel, this is my first redesign for the new `kunalm.com` domain. It's highly inspired by ben.page. Colours come from a palette I had used for a newsletter I used to run called Back of my Head. Fonts are Inter and the default serif font.
