    Hi! I'm Kunal, an electronics major at BITS, Goa.
    <br><br>
    Right now, I'm part-time building new features at <a href="http://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a>, working on a research project on smart spaces at <a href="http://arnabkrpaul.github.io/Dashlab/">DaSH lab</a> and maintaining my indie-saas, <a href="https://socialscri.be/">socialscri.be</a>.
    <br><br>
    Before that, I did computational research at <a href="https://biocomputeinc.com">BioCompute, Inc</a> (they got WTFund'ed).
    <br><br>

    I fell in love with computers and the Internet when I was 10. 
    Ever since, I have written a few newsletters, did SEO, designing and consultant-work for startups and built a bunch of saas products that earned me some
    pocket money.
