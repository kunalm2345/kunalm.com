// Don't build a company that follows competitors. If they add 10 features, you don't need to add 20. Don't be defensive and paranoid.

// <p>Great software solves your own problems, is born out of necessity and you care about it.</p>

// <p>A great way to build software is to start out by solving your own problems. You’ll be the target audience and you’ll know what’s important and what’s not. That gives you a great head start on delivering a breakout product.  —Malcolm Gladwell, author (from A Few Thin Slices of Malcolm Gladwell)</p>

// <h3>Outside money is Plan B</h3>
// <p>Investors slow down the process. Besides you don't need money anyways. Money constrains also force creativity and innovation. Which is a good thing.</p>

// <p>[Jake Walker started one company with investor money (Disclive) and one without (The Show). Here he discusses the differences between the two paths.] The root of all the problems wasn’t raising money itself, but everything that came along with it. The expectations are simply higher. People start taking salary, and the motivation is to build it up and sell it, or find some other way for the initial investors to make their money back. In the case of the first company, we simply started acting much bigger than we were — out of necessity… [With The Show] we realized that we could deliver a much better product with less costs, only with more time. And we gambled with a bit of our own money that people would be willing to wait for quality over speed. But the company has stayed (and will likely continue to be) a small operation. And ever since that first project, we’ve been fully self funded. With just a bit of creative terms from our vendors, we’ve never really needed to put much of our own money into the operation at all. And the expectation isn’t to grow and sell, but to grow for the sake of growth and to continue to benefit from it financially.  —A comment from Signal vs. Noise</p>

// <h3>Fix time and budget. If you can't deliver, lower the scope. This helps you prioritise what really matters. If you fix all 3, what you deliver will have low levels of quality.</h3>

// <p>Scope down. It’s better to make half a product than a half-assed product (more on this later).</p>

// <h3>Have a competitor and sell a different story. Don't sell the story of faster performance when your enemy is doing the same, sell the story of a cheaper price.</h3>

// <p>Have an enemy. Sometimes the best way to know what your app should be is to know what it shouldn’t be. Figure out your app’s enemy and you’ll shine a light on where you need to go.</p>
// </li>
// <li>
// <p>Choose a big competitor. And do what they don't. Often the best way to describe yourself is through a competitor.</p>
// </li>
// <li>
// <p>Take a different angle. Don't sell a story of faster performance when the competition is doing the same, sell the story of a cheaper price. And make people realise your story matters more.  <br>
// And usually you wanna avoid taking lower pricing as your differentiating angle. It's a race to the bottom.</p>

// <p>If your app doesn’t excite you, something’s wrong. If you’re only working on it in order to cash out, it will show. Likewise, if you feel passionately about your app, it will come through in the final product. People can read between the lines.</p>`,
