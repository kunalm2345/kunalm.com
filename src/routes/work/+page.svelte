    <li><b>Building a smart classroom at DaSH Lab</b> – I'm working under Prof Arnab Paul to build a smart classroom environment that monitors student attention and helps improve teaching pedagogy.</li>

<ul class="text-2xl list-inside no-underline">
    <li><b>Built a few features at Buttondown</b> — I built a few features with Django and Vue.js. I've been generally interested in the email industry. It was a dream working with Justin.
    </li> <br>

    <li><b>Researched and wrote scripts for BioCompute</b> — Bacterial DNA can store digital data thousands of times more densely than Seagate's current best tech. We're working on a device which would bring this in a form you can plug into your PC.
    </li> <br>

    <li><b>Did marketing consulting for Deta.space</b> — For a brief stint, Deta hired me to help them think new marketing strategies for their personal cloud product. About an year later, they pivoted to building a browser.
    </li> <br>

    <li><b>Did SEO for HelloMeets</b> — I handled the entire publishing process for the HelloMeets blog while growing it from 600 to over 45k visits a month, in 8 months on a strict budget.
    </li> <br>

    <li><b>Designed an infographic template for The Morning Context</b> — I designed a template for an newly launched, independent, subscription-based news publication called The Morning Context. Thanks Ashish K Mishra and Harveen Ahluwalia for this gig.
    </li> <br>

    <li><b>Did Freelance Content Writing</b> — In 2018-19, I wrote a bunch of articles for Mobisium, a blog that later turned into a content platform but eventually shut down. They paid me peanuts (between ₹180-300 per 1000-2000 words) but it was my first time working for someone else and I loved it. I even pitched them a video that I did alongside a blog post. I also did a few gigs on Fiverr for their minimum $5. I'm just glad I can say I have never worked for anyone else for free and I don't think anyone should.
